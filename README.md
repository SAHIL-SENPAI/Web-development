# Web Development Learning Journey üåê

This repository documents my learning journey in web development, starting with the basics and advancing step-by-step.
I'll be adding projects and exercises as I progress, aiming to build a solid foundation from HTML and CSS up to more complex, full-stack projects.

## Current Progress üìà

**Skills covered so far:**
- HTML: Basics of structuring web pages
- CSS: Styling, layouts, colors, and basic design principles

> _Next up_: JavaScript fundamentals to bring interactivity to my pages.

## Project Structure üìÇ

Each folder contains projects or exercises focused on specific concepts. I'll be updating the README and project list as I advance through new technologies and topics.

### Table of Contents

1. **HTML Projects** - Basic static web pages.
2. **CSS Projects** - Pages with styling, layouts, and design.
3. **JavaScript Basics** - _Coming soon!_
